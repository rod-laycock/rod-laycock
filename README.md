# Bio
I'm Rod Laycock, a professional Software Engineer with over 20 years of experience in various fields ranging from Finance to Government and private sector.

When I'm not designing, writing or documenting software for my job, I'm probably doing something similar for myself or others.

An avid Linux and FOSS adovcate, the open source community and software is thriving place and breading ground for new talent and allows people to showcase their skills.

# Current Interests
I am presently learning C++, I kind of skipped that and went from C to C# so I guess I'm filling in the missing link retrospectively. I'm doing this as I'm also learning to use and code ESP32 microcontrollers.

I have also taken the leap into joining a local Linux User Group - so this keeps me out of trouble a few nights a month.
